### About The Project & Motivation

AWS Streamlit console has been created as a proof of concept with the goal of learning Streamlit and data visualization using Python.

It is a small tool to explore the resources in AWS Cloud using your customized console.

The idea is that you get all of Streamline ability to create Dashboards, customized consoles like AWS or VMware. 

The code here is not perfect, remember it is a simple repo to explore What I can do with this tool.

I already have in my mind a lot of use cases for this incredible combination of Streamlit and Python.
